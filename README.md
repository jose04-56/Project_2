# Project 2

Hello everyone!
This is the repository for the 2dn project_non-linear modelling.

# Project Goal:
Build a non linear model to understad the impact that a technical paper has over the number of electronic vehicles that will be sold in the coming years after the paper is released.

# Data Source:
The dataset for our independent variable will be the time series of technical publications that are related to lithium ion batteries technologies.

# Techniques to be used:
Non Linear modelling.
